# [v1.1.0](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/releases/tag/v1.1.0) - 19 Jun 2021

- Ignore [SC1091](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1091) and [SC2194](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2194) on running shellcheck. These are reported as false positives due to sanitization of `${{ ... }}`. See [the check doc](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint#check-shellcheck-integ) to know the sanitization.
- actionlint replaces `${{ }}` in `run:` scripts before passing them to shellcheck. v1.0.0 replaced `${{ }}` with whitespaces, but it caused syntax errors in some scripts (e.g. `if ${{ ... }}; then ...`). Instead, v1.1.0 replaces `${{ }}` with underscores. For example, `${{ matrix.os }}` is replaced with `________________`.
- Add [download-actionlint.bash](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/blob/main/scripts/download-actionlint.bash) script to download pre-built binary easily on CI services. See [installation document](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint#on-ci) for the usage.
- Better error message on lexing `"` in `${{ }}` expression since double quote is usually misused for string delimiters
- `-ignore` option can now be specified multiple times.
- Fix `github.repositoryUrl` was not correctly resolved in `${{ }}` expression
- Reports an error when `if:` condition does not use `${{ }}` but the expression contains any operators. [The official document](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsif) prohibits this explicitly to avoid conflicts with YAML syntax.
- Clarify that the version of this repository is for `actionlint` CLI tool, not for library. It means that the APIs may have breaking changes on minor or patch version bumps.
- Add more tests and refactor some code. Enumerating quoted items in error message is now done more efficiently and in deterministic order.
